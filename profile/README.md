# Welcome to the fishlinux GitHub!

### What is fishlinux?

Fishlinux is a personal project to learn more about operating systems, DevOps, and to experiment with many other things. The goal of this project is creating an operating system based on Arch Linux, using the original repos, but overriding a couple of packages in favor of different default configurations and such.

This project is very much in the beginning of it's lifecycle, so everything is up to change. Also, needles to say, **no warranty of any kind** is provided for using fishlinux or fishlinux's repositories! It is not aimed to be a production system, only as a learning tool.

### Roadmap
